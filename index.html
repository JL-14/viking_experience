            <h3>Vikings in England</h3>
            <p>The Vikings arrived in the UK in 793 at Lindisfarne, where they ransacked the monastery and settlement on
                Holy Island.
                Even though there are accounts of earlier encounters with Vikings, this was the first full-scale assault
                with extensive
                plundering, slaughter, and the taking of slaves. The significance and brutality of the attack on Holy
                Island quickly
                established their reputation as fearsome warriors, and more incursions soon followed.
                However, the Vikings were not only bloodthirsty warriors. The Vikings brought a new civilisation to the
                UK, settling in
                large parts of England and Scotland, establishing towns and settlements right across the British Isles.
                The legacy of
                the Viking Age in the UK can be found in British culture, language, arts and crafts, placenames, and
                other aspects of
                Britain today.

                <h3>Viking life and sites in Norfolk</h3>
                <!--Add content on viking sites and viking life in Norfolk-->
                <p>The first account of Vikings in Norfolk dates back to 840, when Viking longboats arrived in Flegg
                    (Scratby and Hemsby). They attacked rural towns and villages in the area before moving on to take
                    over
                    East Anglia, killing King Edmund of East Anglia in a battle at Hoxne is Suffolk in 869/870.
                    As the conquest progressed across Norfolk and East Anglia, the Vikings settled down to farm and
                    trade
                    with the locals (and others further afield). The area eventually became known as the Danelaw
                    (reflecting
                    the Danish heritage of the Vikings in East Anglia), which was formalised at the Treaty of Wedmore in
                    886, when Danish King Guthrum converted to Christianity (and changed his name to Athelstan).
                    Whilst there are few remaining Viking sites in Norfolk, the influence of the Vikings is evident in
                    placenames and historical documents and artefacts. Notable towns and locations with Viking heritage
                    include:
                    • The Isle of Flegg
                    • Sheringham
                    • Thetford
                    • Hingham
                    • Norwich

                <h3>Why Viking Experience UK?</h3>
                <p>So what was life like for the Vikings who settled in Norfolk? That is what the Viking Experience UK
                    gives
                    you the chance
                    to explore. We offer experiences that include travelling along the Norfolk coast in a replica Viking
                    longboat,
                    travelling inland ‘raid-style’ (with light tents and equipment), life in a Viking settlement, and
                    exploring Viking arts
                    and crafts.
                    The Viking Experience UK works with experts from the University of East Anglia, English Heritage,
                    the
                    British Museum,
                    and the Ancient Technology Centre in Dorset to name a few, ensuring that the experience is as
                    authentic
                    as possible. We
                    also have links to museums in Scandinavia, offering additional insights. We have a number of core
                    experiences, and can
                    offer bespoke experiences for individuals and schools (please enquire through the contact form).
